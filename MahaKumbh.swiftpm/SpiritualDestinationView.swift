According to Hindu mythology, it is believed that the holy rivers, especially the Ganges, have the power to cleanse individuals of their sins, offering them a chance for spiritual purification. The gathering also allows people to receive blessings from saints and gurus, making it an auspicious event for all who participate."),
            ("What makes bathing in the Ganges during Mahakumbh so special?", "Bathing in the Ganges during Mahakumbh is believed to wash away one's sins and purify the soul. This belief is deeply rooted in Hindu mythology, which says that the gods spilled drops of nectar of immortality (Amrit) into the river, making the waters sacred. Bathing at this time, when specific celestial alignments occur, is believed to enhance the spiritual benefits and lead to salvation (moksha)."),
            ("Why is the Mahakumbh Mela held only every 12 years?", "The Mahakumbh Mela is held every 12 years because it follows a specific astrological alignment that is considered highly auspicious in Hinduism. The event takes place when the planets Jupiter, Sun, and Moon align in a way that enhances the spiritual energy of the gathering."),
            ("Is the Mahakumbh Mela just for religious people?", "While the Mahakumbh Mela is deeply rooted in religious and spiritual beliefs, it is not limited to devout practitioners. People from all walks of life, including those seeking cultural, spiritual, or intellectual experiences, attend the Mahakumbh."),

            ("Why is Mahakumbh Mela considered so sacred compared to other festivals?", "The Mahakumbh Mela is considered sacred because it is based on an ancient myth about the churning of the ocean (Samudra Manthan) for nectar of immortality."),
            ("Can attending the Mahakumbh Mela change someoneâ€™s destiny?", "In Hindu belief, attending the Mahakumbh Mela and taking a dip in the holy rivers can indeed change oneâ€™s destiny by purifying the soul and breaking the cycle of rebirth (samsara)."),
            ("Why do so many saints and sadhus come to the Mahakumbh Mela?", "Saints, sadhus, and spiritual gurus gather at the Mahakumbh Mela because it is seen as the most sacred time and place for spiritual practice."),
